This Dart code demonstrates variable declaration, type inference, type checking, and type conversion. It declares variables of different types: a as an integer, b as a double, c as a num (which can hold both integers and doubles), and name as a string. The program prints the values of these variables along with the runtime type of c, which is inferred as a double since it holds the value 100.65. It also converts the integer a to a string using the toString() method and compares it with the string name. Since a is 5 and name is "1", the comparison evaluates to false. This output highlights how Dart handles type inference, runtime type checking, and string conversions.

This Dart code demonstrates the use of functions, variable assignments, and concise syntax for single-expression functions. The program first prints the string "something" to the console. It then defines two functions, greeting() and getAge(), which return the string 'hello' and the integer 50, respectively. These functions are called, and their return values are assigned to variables greet and age. The values of these variables are then printed, resulting in the output 50 and hello. The shorthand syntax (=>) used in the function definitions highlights Dart's ability to handle single-expression functions efficiently, making the code cleaner and easier to read.

This Dart program demonstrates basic list operations such as adding and removing elements. It begins by creating a list named names containing the initial elements 'jah', 'pau', 'josh', and 'stell'. The program then uses the add() method to append a new element, 'felip', to the list. After that, it removes the element 'stell' using the remove() method. Finally, the program prints the updated list to the console, which now contains ['jah', 'pau', 'josh', 'felip']. This simple code snippet showcases how to manipulate lists in Dart, making it easy to dynamically update their contents.
